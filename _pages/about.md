I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Signal & Image processing track of the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) department at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/research/). I am co-advised by [Clay Scott](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/) and [Laura Balzano](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/).

My research is primarily in Machine Learning, with a particular emphasis on statistics, generative models, and algorithmic fairness.
