**Currently open to ML and Data Science opportunities in industry (bonus points for orgs focused on climate and social justice).**
*I have moved to North Carolina to care for family, and I am currently on leave from my PhD program.*

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Signal & Image processing track of the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) department at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/research/). I am co-advised by [Clay Scott](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/) and [Laura Balzano](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/).

My research is primarily in Machine Learning, with a particular emphasis on generative models, statistical learning, optimization, and fairness.

My technical interests include statistical modeling/analysis, model implementation/training/evaluation (deep, shallow), utilizing transfer learning and foundation models, dealing with large/complex data, and technical communication. My personal interests include music, disc golf, reading, as well as social and environmental justice.
