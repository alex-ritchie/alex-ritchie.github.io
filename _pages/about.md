I am an AI Engineer at [Non-Von](https://www.non-von.com/). I serve as the machine learning subject matter expert on an interdisciplinary team of neuroscientists, hardware architects, and software engineers uniquely suited to the co-design of neuromorphic hardware and machine learning models. I work to synthesize new ideas and models from the latest discoveries regarding learning in the animal brain, and leverage this work to improve and refine system design choices. In addition to my research and design role, I work directly on development of the software components of our system including model training, efficient inference, approximation algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and firmware.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Signal & Image processing track of the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) department at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/research/). I am co-advised by [Clay Scott](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/) and [Laura Balzano](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/). I have been on leave since 2023.

My research is primarily in Machine Learning, with a particular emphasis on generative models, statistical learning, optimization, and fairness.

My technical interests include statistical modeling/analysis, model implementation/training/evaluation (deep, shallow), utilizing transfer learning and foundation models, dealing with large/complex data, and technical communication. My personal interests include music, disc golf, reading, as well as social and environmental justice.
